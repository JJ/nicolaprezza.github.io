# About

<img src="figures/bp.jpg" align="right" width="50%" hspace="30" vspace="0" alt="be balanced" />

Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the university of Pisa since March 2018. Previously (January 2017 - March 2018), I held a postdoc position at the technical university of Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen. Before that (January 2014 - December 2016), I was a PhD student at the university of Udine (Italy). You can download my PhD thesis [here](pdfs/Compressed Computation for Text Indexing.pdf).

My research activity is focused on the study of algorithms for the manipulation and analysis of compressed strings and graphs, both from the theoretical and practical viewpoints and with applications to bioinformatics. My main contributions include (i) the introduction of the notion of *string attractor* (STOC '18), a new combinatorial object able to unify the main compressors for repetitive sequences studied from the 70's (for example, Lempel-Ziv 77), and (ii) the *r-index* (SODA '18), a data structure that solves a problem (fast locate on run-length FM-indexes) that has been open for almost two decades. In 2018, the Italian Chapter of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (IC-EATCS) awarded me the *best italian young researcher in Theoretical Computer Science 2018* award. I am also author of the first C++ library of compressed dynamic data structures ([DYNAMIC](https://github.com/xxsds/DYNAMIC)) and several other software tools for bioinformatics and data compression ([my github page](https://github.com/nicolaprezza)).
