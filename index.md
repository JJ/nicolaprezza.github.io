# About

<img src="figures/io2.jpg" align="right" width="50%" hspace="30" vspace="0" alt="be balanced" />

Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the university of Pisa since March 2018. Previously (January 2017 - March 2018), I held a postdoc position at the technical university of Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen. Before that (January 2014 - December 2016), I was a PhD student at the university of Udine (Italy). You can download my PhD thesis [here](pdfs/Compressed Computation for Text Indexing.pdf).

My research is focused on algorithms and data structures for the manipulation and analysis of compressed strings and graphs, both from the theoretical and practical viewpoints and with applications to bioinformatics. My main contributions include (i) the introduction of the notion of *string attractor* (STOC '18), a new combinatorial object that unifies all known compressors for repetitive sequences introduced in the last decades (for example, grammars, Lempel-Ziv 77, and the run-length BWT), and (ii) the *r-index* (JACM'20, SODA '18), a data structure that solves a problem (fast locate on FM-indexes) that has been open for almost two decades. In 2018, the Italian Chapter of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (IC-EATCS) awarded me the *best italian young researcher in Theoretical Computer Science 2018* award. I am also author of the first C++ library of compressed dynamic data structures ([DYNAMIC](https://github.com/xxsds/DYNAMIC)) and several other software tools for bioinformatics and data compression ([my github page](https://github.com/nicolaprezza)).
